"""
Problem Statement:
Given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i,
find the maximum profit you can achieve from a single buy and a single sell.

Note: You must buy before you sell.

# Example Usage
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
calculator = StockProfitCalculator(prices)
print("Solution:", calculator.brute_force())  # Output: 5

================ Explanation ==================
You are given:
A list of stock prices.
prices[i] means:
→ On day i, the stock price is prices[i].
---
Objective:
Find the maximum profit you can achieve —
By:
Buying stock on any day x
Selling stock on a later day y (where y > x)
---
Constraint:
You can't sell before you buy.
(You can only buy once and sell once.)
