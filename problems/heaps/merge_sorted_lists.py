"""
    ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement (Again)
        You are given k sorted iterators.
        Merge them into a single sorted iterator, such that:
            -> .next() gives the next smallest element.
            -> .has_next() tells if more elements exist.
            -> Every operation should be efficient (not naive rebuilding).

    ðŸ”¥ Key Points
        - Multiple sorted streams â†’ You need a way to always pull the smallest next.
        - Min-Heap allows you to get the minimum efficiently.
        - Lazy fetching â†’ Only load next element when needed, not upfront.
        - Every .next() must do:
            - Pop the smallest from heap.
            - Push the next from that iterator if available.
