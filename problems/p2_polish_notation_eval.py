    Given a Polish (prefix) notation expression like:
        * + 2 3 4
    Evaluate it.

    Polish Notation Rules:
        Operators come before operands.

    For example, * + 2 3 4 means:
        * (2 + 3) 4
        â†’ (2+3) = 5 â†’ 5Ã—4 = 20

    """
    ðŸ’¡Key Observations
        - Operators come first, operands come later.
        - Need to process from right to left (because first you need operands, then operator applies).
        - Use a stack to evaluate.

    ðŸŽ¯ Why This Is Best Solution
        - Reverse traversal correctly handles Polish notation.
        - Stack gives immediate access to operands.
        - Very clean, O(N) time, O(N) space.

    ðŸ§  How to Identify Such Problems
        Signs:        
            - "Prefix Expression" or "Polish Notation" keyword.        
            - Operator appears before operands.
        
        Examples:
            * + 1 2 3            
            + * 2 3 * 4 5
    
    âš¡ How to Solve Quickly in Interview
        If prefix / Polish â†’ read Right to Left.
        
        - Use a stack:
            - If number â†’ push.            
            - If operator â†’ pop two numbers, apply operator, push result.
        
        Final answer will be single element on stack.
    
    ðŸŽ“ How to Master This Type
        Polish/Prefix â†’ RIGHT to LEFT + Stack
        
        Postfix/Reverse Polish â†’ LEFT to RIGHT + Stack
        
        
        Type	Traverse Direction	Stack Usage
        Polish (prefix)	Right â†’ Left	Push numbers, apply operators immediately
        Reverse Polish (postfix)	Left â†’ Right	Push numbers, apply operators immediately
