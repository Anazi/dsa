    ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement
    We are given:
        - A set of libraries.
        - Some libraries depend on others.

    Goal:
        Install libraries in an order such that no library is installed before its dependencies are installed.

    Constraints:
        No cycles (i.e., library A depends on B, and B on A â€” NOT allowed).
        - Dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (no cycles).

    ðŸ“„ Example
        Suppose:
            Library	Depends On
                A	-
                B	A
                C	A
                D	B, C

            Valid Installation Order:
                A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D
                or
                A â†’ C â†’ B â†’ D

            Because:
                B needs A.
                C needs A.
                D needs B and C.

        We will use Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (BFS-based Topological Sort):
            - Track indegrees (number of dependencies).
            - Pick nodes with 0 indegree first (means no pending dependency).
            - After processing, reduce indegrees of connected nodes.


        Steps:
            1. **Build Graph**:

               - Adjacency List â†’ who depends on whom.

               - `indegree`: number of dependencies pending for each library.

            2. **Initialize Queue**:

               - Add all libraries with **0 indegree** (i.e., no dependencies).

            3. **Process Queue**:

               - Remove a library.

               - Add it to output.

               - Decrease indegree of its neighbors.

               - If a neighborâ€™s indegree becomes 0 â†’ add to queue.

            4. **Detect Cycles**:

               - If not all libraries are processed â†’ **Cycle detected** (impossible to install).
